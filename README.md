# HB-UNI-Sen-CURRENT-Sensor-Case

The case is made for the current sensor HB-UNI-Sen-CURRENT by Jérôme. I devided the sensor in two elements, because the sensors are at another place as the display. The two are connected via a 6 pole cable, power supply is given via the sensor to the display. Designed with FreeCad, sliced with PrusaSlicer 2.5.0, printed on Prusa i3 MK3S+, Filament Prusament PETG signal white.
